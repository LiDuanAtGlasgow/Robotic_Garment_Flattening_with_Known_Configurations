# KCNet-GarNet: A Data-Centric Approach For Dual-Armed Robotic Garment Flattening
## Abstract
Robotic garment flattening is a challenge in research due to that garments have infinite numbers of object states. We propose learning known configurations of garments and using pre-designed manipulation plans to flatten those garments. We propose learning the shapes of garments before recognising the known configurations of garments by a garment similarity network. We validate our approach by demonstrating several garment flattenings with a dual-armed Baxter robot.

My name is Li Duan (Ken), and I am a final year PhD student at the University of Glasgow, Scotland. My interests include robot continuous perception and deformable object manipulation. Recently, I have been working on investigating geometric and physical properties of fabrics and garments, through which I am engineering methods to improve robot deformable object manipulations.\
